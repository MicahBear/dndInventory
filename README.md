<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
I wanted to provide a few gaming groups with a resource to help with their tracking of individual character equipment inventory. DMs have had the issue of tracking what npc characters will have in inventory and what the stats for those items may be. So for friends we have inventory management system based on the character entered.
